# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview
I was given data ride share data from three different environments. The data came from different Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas and was used to compare amount of drivers, rides, and cost of fares for each ride. My task was to put this data together and find the similarities and differences between the city types.
## Results
### Urban
 - Number of rides and drivers is more than double the other types.
 - Average fare per ride = $24.53
 - Average driver fare = $16.57
 - The higher supply of drivers brings the fares down for the consumers in Urban areas.
 - Overall the Urban areas made much more fare's per week, but were much more volatile.
### Suburban
- Number of rides and drivers is as expected right in the middle of Urban and Rural areas.
- Average fare per ride = $30.97
- Average driver fare = $39.50
- As expected the middle would have higher fare's than the Urban areas due to less supply.
- Overall week to week the Suburban areas seem to be consistant aside from a drastic drop the first week of March.
### Rural
- Number of rides and drivers is as expected very minimal compared to the Urban and Suburban areas.
Average fare per ride = $34.62
Average driver fare = $55.49
- The supply for ride share drivers is the most scarce in the Rural areas so the prices are much higher.
- Overall week to week although being the lowest the Rural area seems to be the most consistant. This is probably due to lack of newcomers to the area so the same people use the rideshare service everyweek.

## Summary
1. I recommend working with the Urban communities on customer retention to avoid the weekly volatility. This would allow the number to be more consistant and grow more, without having to rely on a tourist spike.
2. I recommend working with the Suburban communities on expansion because they have a lot of room for growth. Working to find drivers with bigger cars would be very beneficial because the Suburban area's consist of a high volume of families.
3. I recommend working with the Rural communities on marketing and expansion. This marketing and expansion would in turn lower fares a little enticing a greator deomographic of people to utilize ride shares.
